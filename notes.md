# Sprint 5 - Really Super Duper Fancy Text Editing
- Links (mostly down here because I don't care that much)
- Autocomplete certain chars (-- to em dash)
- Press ", (, ' etc on selection automatically encapsulates it
- Pressings enter at the end of a paragraph automatically enter-tabs you down into next one (POSSIBLY depending on whether you are using that paragraph style. Check MS/GDocs behavior for guidance.)
- Smallcaps
- Subscript/superscript?
- Fix paste (try pasting from the Lorem ipsum generator - it copys a span in)
- Find and replace

# Sprint 6 - Program Behavior
- Export/import as .docx (could be a beast...)
- Settings screen
  - Text justification
  - Font size
- 💎 Themes (or maybe just option for light/dark mode?)

# Future (out of scope of fall semester)
- Optimizations
- Auto-sync between devices
- Version control
- Drafts (split screen maybe, or highlight and press a button to see the differences between )
- Mobile apps

## Reminders to self

Make it **work** first. Focus on the most naive solution, and improvements can be tacked on later.
