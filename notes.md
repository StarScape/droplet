# Sprint 4 - Aesthetics
- Make it pretty!
  - Font
  - Colors
- Bottom toolbar
  - Make buttons for everything
  - Light up buttons when italics/bold/whatever is on
- 💎 Distraction-free (fullscreen) mode

# Sprint 5 - Really Super Duper Fancy Text Editing
- Links (mostly down here because I don't care that much)
- Autocomplete certain chars (-- to em dash)
- Press ", (, ' etc on selection automatically encapsulates it
- Pressings enter at the end of a paragraph automatically enter-tabs you down into next one (POSSIBLY depending on whether you are using that paragraph style. Check MS/GDocs behavior for guidance.)
- Smallcaps
- Subscript/superscript?
- Fix paste (try pasting from the Lorem ipsum generator - it copys a span in)
- Find and replace
- Control+Enter goes to new line

# Sprint 6 - Program Behavior
- Export/import as .docx (could be a beast...)
- Settings screen
  - Text justification
  - Font size
- Remember the size and location user left window at
- 💎 Themes (or maybe just option for light/dark mode?)

# Future (out of scope of fall semester)
- Optimizations
- Auto-sync between devices
- Version control
- Drafts (split screen maybe, or highlight and press a button to see the differences between )
- Mobile apps
- Reading mode

## Todos (independent of the roadmap, but need to get done at some point)

# Architecture
- Make an interface for global actions ✔️
- Better interface for opening/closing files
- Throw out contenteditable and write your own

## Key
✔️ = done
❌ = cancelled
❗= delayed (don't forget)
💎 = milestone :)

## Reminders to self

Make it **work** first. Focus on the most naive solution, and improvements can be tacked on later.
