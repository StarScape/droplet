# Sprint 4 - Aesthetics
- Make it pretty!
  - Typography
  - Colors
- Bottom toolbar
  - Make buttons for everything
  - Light up buttons when italics/bold/whatever is on
  - Maybe make the justification buttons *underline* instead of highlighting

- 💎 Distraction-free (fullscreen) mode

# Sprint 5 - Really Super Duper Fancy Text Editing
- Autocompletion
  - (-- to em dash) ✔️
  - Auto-close (, ", ' (' when not apostrophe) ✔️
  - Undo autocomplete on backspace ✔️
  - Autocomplete unordered lists on "* " ✔️
  - Autocomplete ordered lists on "1. "
  - Press ", (, ' with multi-selection automatically encapsulates it
  - Pressings enter at the end of a paragraph automatically enter-tabs you down into next one (POSSIBLY depending on whether you are using that paragraph style. Check MS/GDocs behavior for guidance.)
    - Replace em-space with a specially-styled span (maybe?)

- Smallcaps
- Subscript/superscript
- Links (mostly down here because I don't care that much)
- Control+Enter goes to new line?

# Sprint 6 - Program Behavior
- Fix nasty document layout
  - UL bug ✔️
  - Italics/bold at start bug

- Fix paste (try pasting from the Lorem ipsum generator - it copys a span in)
- Export/import as .docx
- Find and replace
- Settings screen
  - Text justification
  - Font size
  - Items on bar (fullscreen and not)
- Remember the size and location user left window at
- 💎 Themes (or maybe just option for light/dark mode?)

# Future (out of scope of fall semester)
- Optimizations
- Auto-sync between devices
- Version control
- Drafts (split screen maybe, or highlight and press a button to see the differences between )
- Mobile apps
- Reading mode

## Bugs

- Auto-close: currently it relies on input history. Add a mouse click to input history. so that shit isn't fucked

- Pressing tab when italic is active undones italic.

- Opening a file and immediately on the first line hitting ctrl+i and then typing results in a raw `<i>` not wrapped in a paragraph element. POSSIBLE SOLUTION: check for no-enclosing-p on EVERY command. This could be done easily with a lil wrapper function. ANOTHER SOLUTION: the `if (firstChild && firstChild.nodeType === 3)...` line in `handleInput` is calling `formatBlock` if the firstChild is a textNode. Check for italics, bold, etc as well. Either of these should work, you'll have to decide which works better.

## Todos (independent of the roadmap, but need to get done at some point)

# Architecture
- Make an interface for global actions ✔️
- Better interface for opening/closing files
- Throw out contenteditable and write your own

## Key
✔️ = done
❌ = cancelled
❗= delayed (don't forget)
💎 = milestone :)

## Reminders to self

Make it **work** first. Focus on the most naive solution, and improvements can be tacked on later.
